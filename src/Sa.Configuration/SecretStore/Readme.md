# Secrets Class

The `Secrets` class provides a unified way to manage and retrieve sensitive information, such as API keys, database passwords, and other configuration settings, from various sources. It is designed to facilitate secure access to secrets in your application, allowing you to easily populate placeholders in strings with the corresponding secret values.

## Features
- Chained Secret Stores: The Secrets class can combine multiple secret stores, allowing you to retrieve secrets from different sources in a prioritized manner. This includes:
	- File-based Secrets: Load secrets from a primary secrets file (e.g., secrets.txt).
	- Environment-specific Secrets: Load secrets from environment-specific files (e.g., secrets.Development.txt), enabling different configurations for different environments.
	- Environment Variables: Retrieve secrets stored as environment variables, providing flexibility for deployment in various environments.
- Dynamic Host Key Handling: The class can dynamically load additional secret files based on a host key defined in the primary secrets file. This allows for environment-specific configurations that can be tailored to different deployment scenarios.
- Placeholder Replacement: The Secrets class allows you to populate strings with secret values by using placeholders. For example, you can define a string like "Database password: {{db_password}}", and the class will replace {{db_password}} with the actual value retrieved from the secret stores.


## Example

Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the Secrets class:

```csharp
string input = "API Key: {{api_key}}, Database Password: {{db_password}}";
string? result = Secrets.Service.PopulateSecrets(input);

Console.WriteLine(result); // Outputs: "API Key: my_api_key, Database Password: my_db_password"
```


## Conclusion
The Secrets class simplifies the management of sensitive information in your application, providing a flexible and secure way to access secrets from various sources. By using this class, you can ensure that your application remains configurable and secure across different environments.
